# Project 1 - Intro to Interactive Programming in Python
## Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

This was my very first programming project, submitted to Rice University's online offering of its Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (IIPIP).

This is a command-line implementation of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.

Originally, it was only a simulation of the game; it has been updated to accept user input, compare against a randomized computer choice, and keep track of the score.

### Running the game
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed - type `python -V` at the command line to see if and which version you have installed.
- Run the program using `python -m rpsls-game` and follow the prompts.
