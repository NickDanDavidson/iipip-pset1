# Project 1 - Intro to Interactive Programming in Python
## Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

Submitted Fall 2012.
Command-line implementation of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
Originally, it was only a simulation of the game; now it accepts user input, compares against a randomized computer choice, and keeps track of the score.

### Running the game
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed - type `python -V` at the command line to see if and which version you have installed.
- Run the program using `python -m rpsls` and follow the prompts.
